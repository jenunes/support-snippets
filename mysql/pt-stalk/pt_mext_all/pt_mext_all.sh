#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This bash script will iterate through all mysqladmin output files from a
# pt-stalk sample and will run pt-mext on them.
# It will remove multiline Rsa_public_key status output, since it breaks
# pt-mext.
#
# The script can receive one parameter. If it's used, then it will assume it's
# the path to the directory with the samples. If not, it will use the output of
# running `pwd`, which should give the current working directory. NOTE that the
# tool will not do any checks on what is received as first parameter.
#
# The script will work on both Linux and MacOS (in-file substitution is
# resolved differently in both).
#
# To run, simply execute as `./pt_mext_all path_to_samples`

# Constants:
# If we have a first parameter, assume it's the path to samples directory
# If not, use current working directory
readonly TARGET_DIR="${1:-`pwd`}"
